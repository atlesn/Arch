# st

st 0.8.4

This build of st uses the following two fonts:

* aur/nerd-fonts-hack
* extra/ttf-hack

Please note that Hack Nerd Font must be installed manually. This is optional though, as st will use Hack Font as the fallback.

The following patches are installed:

* alphaFocusHighlight
* scrollback
* scrollback-mouse
* scrollback-mouse-altscreen
